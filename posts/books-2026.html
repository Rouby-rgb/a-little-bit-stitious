        <p class="post-intro">I've always believed that books are the most affordable form of mentorship. You can sit with some of the wisest people in the world for the price of a paperback and a cup of tea. This year, I set a goal to read 24 books &mdash; two per month &mdash; and while I'm only getting started, a few books have already shaken me in the best way possible. Here are five that I genuinely cannot stop recommending.</p>

        <h2>Why Reading Matters to Me</h2>
        <p>I wasn't always a reader. Growing up, I read what school required and not much else. It wasn't until my early twenties that I picked up a personal development book on a whim, and something just clicked. Reading became my quiet time, my therapy, my way of growing without needing to leave my room. Now I read every single night before bed &mdash; even if it's just ten pages. It's become one of my most treasured habits.</p>
        <p>This year's list is a wild mix &mdash; faith, self-improvement, psychological thriller, ancient strategy, and a brutally honest take on modern life. That's exactly how I like it. Let's get into it.</p>

        <h2>The Books</h2>

        <h3>1. "The Pursuit of God" by A.W. Tozer</h3>
        <p><strong>Genre: Faith &amp; Spirituality</strong></p>
        <p>This book wrecked me in the most beautiful way. Tozer writes about the deep, aching hunger of the human soul for God &mdash; not religion, not routine, but a genuine, intimate pursuit of His presence. Every chapter felt like a mirror being held up to my spiritual life, gently asking, <em>"Are you actually pursuing Him, or just going through the motions?"</em></p>
        <p>I read this one slowly, a chapter a day during my morning devotionals, and it completely transformed how I approach prayer and worship. Tozer's writing is from another era, but it hits like it was written yesterday.</p>
        <p><strong>Favorite takeaway:</strong> <em>"We pursue God because, and only because, He has first put an urge within us that spurs us to the pursuit."</em> That line stopped me in my tracks. I actually wrote it on a sticky note and put it on my mirror.</p>
        <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Anyone who feels spiritually dry, anyone craving a deeper relationship with God beyond Sunday mornings.</p>

        <h3>2. "Atomic Habits" by James Clear</h3>
        <p><strong>Genre: Personal Development</strong></p>
        <p>I know, I know &mdash; everyone and their mother has read this book. But there's a reason it's everywhere. James Clear breaks down the science of habit-building into such a practical, doable framework that you actually <em>want</em> to change your life after reading it. The core idea is simple: forget about goals, focus on systems. Improve by just 1% each day and let compound growth do its thing.</p>
        <p>What I loved most is how he addresses identity-based habits &mdash; you don't just <em>do</em> healthy things, you become a healthy person. That shift in thinking changed how I approach everything from my skincare routine to my prayer life to this blog.</p>
        <p><strong>Favorite takeaway:</strong> <em>"You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems."</em> This gave me so much peace during weeks when I felt like nothing was moving forward with my blog and business.</p>
        <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Literally everyone. But especially goal-setters, perfectionists, and anyone who keeps starting things but can't seem to stick with them.</p>

        <h3>3. "All Her Fault" by Andrea Mara</h3>
        <p><strong>Genre: Psychological Thriller</strong></p>
        <p>Oh, this book. I read it in two days because I simply could not put it down. It starts with a mother arriving to pick up her son from a playdate &mdash; only to find he's not there. No one knows where he is. And then things get really, really twisted. Andrea Mara layers suspicion, secrets, and suburban unease so masterfully that I was genuinely suspicious of every single character by chapter ten.</p>
        <p>I love a good thriller, and this one kept me guessing until the very last page. The twist? I did NOT see it coming. I actually gasped out loud on my couch at midnight. If you're into books that make your heart race, add this to your list immediately.</p>
        <p><strong>Favorite takeaway:</strong> Without spoiling anything &mdash; this book reminded me that people are rarely who they seem to be, and assumptions can be dangerous. Also, always trust your gut.</p>
        <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Thriller lovers, fans of twisty domestic suspense, anyone who needs a book they literally cannot put down.</p>

        <h3>4. "The Art of War" by Sun Tzu</h3>
        <p><strong>Genre: Strategy &amp; Philosophy</strong></p>
        <p>Yes, I read a 2,500-year-old military strategy book, and yes, it changed my life. Before you judge me &mdash; hear me out. Sun Tzu isn't just writing about war. He's writing about strategy, discipline, knowing yourself, knowing your environment, and making calculated moves. Every single principle applies to modern life: business, relationships, personal growth, even navigating difficult conversations.</p>
        <p>I kept a notebook beside me while reading this one. The chapters are short and dense, almost like proverbs, and each one is worth sitting with for a while. It made me think more strategically about how I spend my time, energy, and attention.</p>
        <p><strong>Favorite takeaway:</strong> <em>"In the midst of chaos, there is also opportunity."</em> Simple, ancient, and absolutely timeless. I think about this one weekly.</p>
        <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Entrepreneurs, leaders, anyone who wants to think more strategically about life, or anyone curious about ancient wisdom that still applies today.</p>

        <h3>5. "The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck" by Mark Manson</h3>
        <p><strong>Genre: Self-Help / Personal Development</strong></p>
        <p>This book is the anti-positivity, anti-hustle-culture wake-up call I didn't know I needed. Mark Manson's argument is refreshingly blunt: we have a limited number of things we can care about, so we'd better choose wisely. Stop trying to be positive all the time. Stop chasing "more." Figure out what actually matters to you and let everything else go.</p>
        <p>I'll be honest &mdash; some parts of this book made me uncomfortable, and that's exactly the point. It challenged my people-pleasing tendencies, my need for external validation, and my habit of saying yes to things I should absolutely be saying no to. It's raw, it's profane, and it's surprisingly deep beneath all the swearing.</p>
        <p><strong>Favorite takeaway:</strong> <em>"Who you are is defined by what you're willing to struggle for."</em> That reframed everything for me. It's not about what you <em>want</em> &mdash; it's about what pain you're willing to endure to get it.</p>
        <p><strong>Best for:</strong> People-pleasers, overthinkers, anyone tired of toxic positivity, and anyone who needs a brutally honest perspective on what really matters.</p>

        <h2>How I Choose What to Read</h2>
        <p>People always ask me how I pick my books, so here's my little system:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Recommendations from people I trust</strong> &mdash; If someone whose values align with mine suggests a book, it goes straight on the list.</li>
          <li><strong>Genre rotation</strong> &mdash; I never read two books from the same genre back-to-back. It keeps my reading life balanced and prevents burnout.</li>
          <li><strong>The "first 30 pages" rule</strong> &mdash; If a book doesn't grab me in the first 30 pages, I give myself permission to put it down. Life is too short for books that feel like homework.</li>
          <li><strong>Seasonal themes</strong> &mdash; At the start of the year, I gravitate toward books about goals and fresh starts. Mid-year, I lean into fiction and thrillers. End of year, I love reflective memoirs and faith reads.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>What I love about this list is how different each book is. A devotional classic, a habit-building framework, a heart-pounding thriller, ancient military strategy, and a no-nonsense guide to caring less about the wrong things. Together, they've made me more intentional, more strategic, more discerning, and honestly &mdash; more at peace.</p>
