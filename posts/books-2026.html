        <p class="post-intro">I've always believed that books are the most affordable form of mentorship. You can sit with some of the wisest people in the world for the price of a paperback and a cup of tea. This year, I set a goal to read 24 books &mdash; two per month &mdash; and while I'm only getting started, a few books have already shaken me in the best way possible. Here are five that I genuinely cannot stop recommending.</p>

        <h2>Why Reading Matters to Me</h2>
        <p>I wasn't always a reader. Growing up, I read what school required and not much else. It wasn't until my early twenties that I picked up a personal development book on a whim, and something just clicked. Reading became my quiet time, my therapy, my way of growing without needing to leave my room. Now I read every single night before bed &mdash; even if it's just ten pages. It's become one of my most treasured habits.</p>
        <p>My 2026 reading goal is 24 books, and I'm tracking every single one in my journal. I alternate between genres so I never burn out &mdash; a faith book followed by fiction, then something on business, then a memoir. It keeps things fresh and exciting. If you're trying to build a reading habit, I highly recommend this approach.</p>

        <h2>The Books</h2>

        <h3>1. "Anchored in Grace" by Priscilla Mensah</h3>
        <p><strong>Genre: Faith &amp; Spirituality</strong></p>
        <p>This book came into my life at the exact right moment. Priscilla Mensah writes about finding spiritual steadiness in a world that constantly pulls you in different directions. She explores what it means to truly rest in God's promises &mdash; not just intellectually, but with your whole heart. Each chapter ends with a prayer and reflection prompt that I actually used during my morning devotionals.</p>
        <p><strong>Favorite takeaway:</strong> <em>"Grace doesn't mean the storm won't come. It means you won't drown in it."</em> That line stopped me in my tracks. I actually wrote it on a sticky note and put it on my mirror.</p>
        <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Anyone going through a season of uncertainty who needs to be reminded that God's got them, even when the path isn't clear.</p>

        <h3>2. "The 1% Shift" by Daniel Okoro</h3>
        <p><strong>Genre: Personal Development</strong></p>
        <p>Daniel Okoro's premise is simple but powerful: you don't need a massive overhaul to change your life. You just need to improve by one percent each day. He backs it up with research, real-life stories, and practical daily challenges that are actually doable. I loved how he addressed the overwhelm that comes with trying to "fix everything at once" &mdash; something I've definitely been guilty of.</p>
        <p><strong>Favorite takeaway:</strong> <em>"Progress isn't always visible, but it's always happening if you're showing up."</em> This gave me so much peace during weeks when I felt like nothing was moving forward with my blog and business.</p>
        <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Goal-setters, perfectionists, and anyone who needs permission to take things one step at a time.</p>

        <h3>3. "The Garden Between Us" by Nana Ama Adjei</h3>
        <p><strong>Genre: Fiction</strong></p>
        <p>Oh, this novel. I read it in three days because I simply could not put it down. It follows two childhood best friends in Kumasi whose lives take radically different paths after university. One stays, one leaves for London, and over ten years, their friendship is tested by distance, jealousy, grief, and ultimately, forgiveness. The writing is lush, the characters are deeply human, and I cried actual tears on the bus while reading the final chapter.</p>
        <p><strong>Favorite takeaway:</strong> <em>"We don't outgrow the people we love. We just grow in different directions and hope the roots hold."</em> If you've ever navigated a complicated friendship, this one will hit home.</p>
        <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Lovers of literary fiction, anyone who appreciates beautiful West African storytelling, or anyone healing from a friendship that changed.</p>

        <h3>4. "Launch with What You Have" by Efua Sintim</h3>
        <p><strong>Genre: Business &amp; Entrepreneurship</strong></p>
        <p>Efua Sintim is a Ghanaian entrepreneur who built a six-figure brand starting with literally her phone and a notebook. This book is practical, no-nonsense, and deeply encouraging for anyone who thinks they need to have everything figured out before they start. She covers branding, content creation, pricing, and the mindset shifts required to actually bet on yourself. As someone who's building a blog and exploring business ideas, this book felt like it was written specifically for me.</p>
        <p><strong>Favorite takeaway:</strong> <em>"You don't need a perfect plan. You need a brave first step and the willingness to figure it out as you go."</em> I highlighted this so aggressively my highlighter nearly ran out.</p>
        <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Aspiring entrepreneurs, content creators, side-hustlers, and anyone who keeps waiting for the "right time" to start.</p>

        <h3>5. "Daughter of the Coast" by Abena Kyei</h3>
        <p><strong>Genre: Memoir</strong></p>
        <p>This memoir is breathtaking. Abena Kyei writes about growing up in Cape Coast, losing her mother at fifteen, being raised by her grandmother, and eventually finding her way to journalism. Her writing is raw, poetic, and deeply moving. She doesn't shy away from pain, but she also doesn't dwell in it &mdash; there's this undercurrent of hope and resilience that carries the entire book. I felt like I was sitting across from her, listening to her tell her story over kenkey and fish.</p>
        <p><strong>Favorite takeaway:</strong> <em>"My grandmother taught me that strength isn't the absence of tears. It's planting a garden the morning after the storm."</em> This one stayed with me for days.</p>
        <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Anyone who loves memoirs, West African literature, or stories about women who refuse to be defined by their hardest moments.</p>

        <h2>How I Choose What to Read</h2>
        <p>People always ask me how I pick my books, so here's my little system:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Recommendations from people I trust</strong> &mdash; If someone whose values align with mine suggests a book, it goes straight on the list.</li>
          <li><strong>Genre rotation</strong> &mdash; I never read two books from the same genre back-to-back. It keeps my reading life balanced and prevents burnout.</li>
          <li><strong>The "first 30 pages" rule</strong> &mdash; If a book doesn't grab me in the first 30 pages, I give myself permission to put it down. Life is too short for books that feel like homework.</li>
          <li><strong>Seasonal themes</strong> &mdash; At the start of the year, I gravitate toward books about goals and fresh starts. Mid-year, I lean into fiction. End of year, I love reflective memoirs and faith reads.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>Reading has genuinely shaped who I am. It's made me more empathetic, more curious, more intentional about my faith and my goals. If you're looking for a sign to pick up a book today, this is it. Start with whichever title on this list calls to you &mdash; I promise you won't regret it.</p>
        <p>I'd love to swap book recommendations with you! Send me yours on my <a href="../contact.html">Contact page</a> or DM me on Instagram. Let's build our reading lists together.</p>
