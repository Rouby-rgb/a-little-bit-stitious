        <p class="post-intro">This is probably the most vulnerable post I've ever written. But I feel like God has been nudging me to share this for weeks now, and if there's even one person reading this who's in a season of waiting, I want you to know: you're not alone, you're not forgotten, and your time is coming. Let me tell you what I've been learning about trusting God's timing &mdash; the hard way, the beautiful way, and everything in between.</p>

        <h2>The Season That Tested My Faith</h2>
        <p>About two years ago, I went through a season that I can only describe as a standstill. I had been working toward a dream &mdash; building something I felt deeply called to create &mdash; and every single door kept closing. Applications got rejected. Opportunities fell through at the last minute. Plans I had carefully laid out crumbled in ways that felt almost personal, like the universe was specifically telling me <em>no</em>.</p>
        <p>I remember one evening sitting on my bed, journal open, tears running down my face, writing the same prayer I'd been writing for months: <em>"God, I don't understand. I thought this was what You wanted for me. Why isn't it happening?"</em></p>
        <p>That season lasted longer than I thought I could bear. There were days when my faith felt paper-thin, days when I questioned whether I had heard God correctly in the first place, days when I watched other people receive the very things I'd been praying for and had to fight the bitterness that crept into my heart. I'm being honest because I think we don't talk about this part enough &mdash; the part where faith doesn't feel victorious or Instagram-worthy. The part where it just feels like holding on by a thread.</p>

        <h2>What the Bible Says About Waiting</h2>
        <p>In the middle of that season, I clung to Scripture like a lifeline. Three verses in particular became my anchors:</p>

        <h3>Ecclesiastes 3:11</h3>
        <p><em>"He has made everything beautiful in its time. He has also set eternity in the human heart; yet no one can fathom what God has done from beginning to end."</em></p>
        <p>This verse wrecked me in the best way. "Beautiful in its time" &mdash; not in <em>my</em> time, not on <em>my</em> schedule, but in <em>His</em> time. And the part about eternity being set in our hearts? I think that's why waiting is so painful. We're wired for more, for the fullness of what God has promised, and living in the gap between the promise and the fulfillment requires a kind of trust that goes beyond logic.</p>

        <h3>Isaiah 40:31</h3>
        <p><em>"But those who hope in the Lord will renew their strength. They will soar on wings like eagles; they will run and not grow weary, they will walk and not be faint."</em></p>
        <p>I love that this verse includes walking. Not just soaring, not just running &mdash; but walking. Because sometimes faith isn't dramatic or exciting. Sometimes it's just putting one foot in front of the other, day after day, when you can't see where the path leads. And God promises strength even for that.</p>

        <h3>Habakkuk 2:3</h3>
        <p><em>"For the revelation awaits an appointed time; it speaks of the end and will not prove false. Though it linger, wait for it; it will certainly come and will not delay."</em></p>
        <p>An <em>appointed</em> time. Not a late time. Not a forgotten time. An appointed one. God's timing isn't behind schedule &mdash; it's precisely on schedule. We just can't see the full calendar from where we're standing. This verse gave me peace on the nights when I was most tempted to give up.</p>

        <h2>What That Season Taught Me</h2>
        <p>Looking back now, I can see so clearly what God was doing in that waiting period, even though I couldn't see it at the time. He was working on the very things I kept asking Him to hurry up about &mdash; just not in the way I expected.</p>

        <h3>He Was Preparing Me</h3>
        <p>The truth is, I wasn't ready for what I was asking for. I wanted the destination without the development. I wanted the platform without the patience. I wanted the blessing without the character that would be required to steward it well. That waiting season grew me in ways that nothing else could have. It deepened my prayer life, stripped away my need for control, and taught me that my worth isn't tied to my productivity or achievements. Those lessons had to come <em>before</em> the breakthrough, not after.</p>

        <h3>He Was Redirecting Me</h3>
        <p>Some of those closed doors? They were actually protection. I can look back now and see that certain opportunities I desperately wanted would not have been right for me. God wasn't saying no &mdash; He was saying "not this, something better." But in the moment, all I could feel was the sting of the closed door. I couldn't see the open window yet.</p>

        <h3>He Was Drawing Me Closer</h3>
        <p>My relationship with God is deeper now than it was before that season, and I don't think that's a coincidence. When everything else was stripped away &mdash; when I couldn't rely on my plans, my timelines, or my own understanding &mdash; all I had left was Him. And you know what? He was enough. He was more than enough. That's a truth I might have known intellectually before, but I know it in my bones now.</p>

        <h2>How My Faith Grew Through the Waiting</h2>
        <p>I started doing a few things during that season that fundamentally changed my faith:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>I kept a gratitude journal</strong> &mdash; Even on the hardest days, I wrote down three things I was grateful for. It trained my heart to look for God's goodness even when my circumstances felt discouraging.</li>
          <li><strong>I praised before the breakthrough</strong> &mdash; This was the hardest one. Worshipping God not because He gave me what I wanted, but because He is worthy regardless. Praise in the waiting is a powerful act of faith.</li>
          <li><strong>I surrounded myself with faith-filled people</strong> &mdash; My church community carried me through that season. Having people who could pray with me, remind me of God's faithfulness, and simply sit with me in the uncertainty was everything.</li>
          <li><strong>I memorized Scripture</strong> &mdash; Having God's Word hidden in my heart meant that when doubt crept in at 2 AM, I had truth to combat it with. I'd whisper those verses to myself like a lifeline, because that's exactly what they were.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>For Anyone in a Waiting Season Right Now</h2>
        <p>If you're reading this from the middle of your own waiting season, I want to speak directly to you for a moment.</p>
        <p>I know it's hard. I know there are days when the waiting feels endless and the silence from God feels deafening. I know you've probably asked "why" and "when" more times than you can count. I know you might be looking at other people's blessings and wondering if God forgot about you.</p>
        <p>He didn't forget. He hasn't forgotten. Your name is written on His hands, and your story is being authored by Someone who knows the ending and calls it good.</p>
        <p>You don't have to understand the timing to trust the One who holds it. You don't have to feel brave to act in faith. You just have to keep showing up &mdash; keep praying, keep believing, keep putting one foot in front of the other. Even when it's just a walk, not a soar. Even when it's just a whisper of faith instead of a shout.</p>
        <p>God is doing something. Right now, in this very moment, even if you can't see it or feel it. He is working all things together for your good, and His timing &mdash; though it may not be yours &mdash; is perfect.</p>

        <h2>Where I Am Now</h2>
        <p>I'm writing this blog post on the other side of that season, and I can tell you with full confidence: it was worth the wait. What God had for me was so much bigger, so much more beautiful, so much more <em>right</em> than what I had been trying to force into existence on my own timeline. And the woman I became in the waiting? She was necessary for the blessing.</p>
        <p>So if I could go back and tell my crying, journaling, praying self one thing, it would be this: <em>Don't rush the process, love. God's timing is not your enemy &mdash; it's your greatest gift.</em></p>
        <p>I'm praying for every person reading this who is in a season of waiting. May you find peace in the pause and strength in the stillness. And may you look back one day and see, with absolute clarity, that every single moment of the wait was purposeful.</p>
