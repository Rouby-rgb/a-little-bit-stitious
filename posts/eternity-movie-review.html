        <p>So I watched <em>Eternity</em> on Apple TV the other night, and I just need to talk about it.</p>

        <p>I wasn't expecting much, honestly. I'd scrolled past it a few times, thought the poster looked pretty enough, and figured it was going to be one of those slow-burn romances that takes itself too seriously. But I was in my cozy girl era that evening &mdash; blanket, tea, no plans &mdash; so I pressed play.</p>

        <p>And oh, I'm so glad I did. This movie had me laughing, thinking, and genuinely tearing up by the end. So let's get into it.</p>

        <p><em>(Fair warning &mdash; there are spoilers ahead. If you haven't watched it yet, go do that first and come back. I'll wait.)</em></p>

        <h2>The Storyline</h2>

        <p>The premise is so clever. When you die, you arrive at a place called the Junction &mdash; a bureaucratic, slightly absurd afterlife waystation where you're given seven days to choose how you'll spend eternity. You show up as the version of yourself from your happiest age, and you pick from a menu of forever options: Beach World, 1960s Paris, a nudist colony, a Men-Free World &mdash; yes, really &mdash; among others. It's hilarious and weirdly charming at the same time.</p>

        <p>Larry (Miles Teller) gets there first. He dies choking on a pretzel on the way to a family gender-reveal party &mdash; and honestly, the way the movie handles his death is both tragic and a little bit funny, which sets the tone for everything that follows. One second he's surrounded by grandkids, the next he's jolting awake on a train, decades younger.</p>

        <p>Joan (Elizabeth Olsen) arrives shortly after. She had cancer &mdash; a diagnosis they'd kept quiet. She shows up at the Junction looking young and radiant, and Larry is overjoyed to see her. But then comes the twist.</p>

        <div class="pull-quote">Luke &mdash; Joan's first husband, who died in the Korean War two years into their marriage &mdash; has been waiting at the Junction for her. For sixty-seven years.</div>

        <p>Sixty-seven years. Let that sit with you for a moment. Luke (Callum Turner) never chose his eternity. He stayed, working as an Afterlife Coordinator, just waiting for Joan to arrive. And now she has to choose: the man she built an entire life with, or the love she never got to fully live.</p>

        <h2>The Two Eternities</h2>

        <p>This is where the movie really gets you. The afterlife coordinators Anna and Ryan set it up so Joan can sample both options before making her final choice.</p>

        <p><strong>Luke's eternity</strong> is a mountain paradise &mdash; peaceful, beautiful, frozen in the romance of what could have been. There are these Archives in the mountains, long dim tunnels where memories come alive as life-sized moving dioramas. Joan walks through their brief courtship, their wedding, the heartbreaking moment he shipped off to war. It's gorgeous. It's aching. It represents the love she never got to finish.</p>

        <p><strong>Larry's eternity</strong> is a beach world &mdash; warm, familiar, lived-in. Their rhythm comes back immediately. Joan tells him about his funeral, they laugh about their first date (which involved a flat tire), and it feels like <em>home</em>. Not the exciting, butterflies kind of love. The "I know exactly how you take your tea and I'll argue with you about the thermostat for the rest of forever" kind of love.</p>

        <p>And that contrast? That's the whole movie, right there.</p>

        <h2>The Ending That Got Me</h2>

        <p>Joan initially chooses Luke. And honestly? I understood it. Larry even steps aside &mdash; because he notices that Joan's younger self, the version from her happiest time, has longer hair. The way she looked when she was with Luke. He loves her enough to let her go. That moment broke me a little.</p>

        <p>But here's where the movie does something so beautiful and so real.</p>

        <p>Joan and Luke start their mountain eternity together, and at first it's lovely. But slowly, Joan starts drifting. She keeps going back to the Archives &mdash; not to relive memories with Luke, but to watch the ordinary moments with Larry. Meeting at the library. Raising their son. A random argument in the car right before Larry died that somehow, in the afterlife, feels tender instead of frustrating.</p>

        <div class="pull-quote">She doesn't miss the grand romance. She misses the Tuesday mornings. The bickering. The comfort that only comes with time.</div>

        <p>Luke sees it. He knows. And in the most heartbreaking act of love, he lets her go.</p>

        <p>Joan finds Larry at the Junction &mdash; he'd left Beach World and was tending bar, just existing, because eternity without her wasn't paradise no matter how perfect the beach was. And their final choice? Not a beach. Not a mountain. A familiar, tree-lined suburban street that looks exactly like the neighborhood they lived in. Joan looks around and says, "It's perfect."</p>

        <p>I was done. Absolutely done. Tea went cold. Blanket pulled up to my chin. Eyes fully wet.</p>

        <h2>The Comedy That Makes It Work</h2>

        <p>What keeps this movie from being an emotional wrecking ball is the comedy. And it's not forced &mdash; it's woven into the absurdity of the afterlife itself. The bureaucracy of death? Hilarious. The different eternity options? Comedy gold. John Early and Da'Vine Joy Randolph as the afterlife coordinators are genuinely funny &mdash; they bring this dry, deadpan energy that balances out all the heavy romantic stuff perfectly.</p>

        <p>And Miles Teller as Larry is so naturally funny. He's not cracking jokes &mdash; he's just being a regular guy who's confused and slightly annoyed by the afterlife's admin process, and it works so well. There's a screwball comedy energy to the whole thing that reminded me of classic rom-coms but with way more emotional depth.</p>

        <h2>What This Movie Taught Me</h2>

        <p>Okay, here's where I get a little personal. Because this movie isn't just a cute rom-com with a fantasy twist. It's asking some really deep questions about love, and I think the answers it gives are worth sitting with.</p>

        <h3>1. The love you choose every day is more powerful than the love that got away</h3>

        <p>We all have a Luke. Maybe not a literal person, but a "what if." A path not taken. A version of our lives that exists only in our imagination, and because it was never tested by reality, it stays perfect forever. This movie says: that perfection is a mirage. The love that weathers the flat tires and the cancer diagnoses and the sixty-five years of thermostat arguments? That's the real thing. That's eternity.</p>

        <h3>2. Nostalgia is beautiful, but it's not a place you can live</h3>

        <p>Joan's time in Luke's mountain paradise was beautiful, but it was built on memory, not on life. She kept going back to the Archives because the real, messy, imperfect memories with Larry were more alive to her than a curated forever with Luke. That hit me. How often do we romanticize the past at the expense of what's right in front of us?</p>

        <h3>3. Real love sometimes means letting go</h3>

        <p>Both men in this movie let Joan go at different points. Larry steps aside because he sees her happiness. Luke releases her because he sees her heart isn't fully there. Neither of them makes it about themselves. That is love. Not possession, not desperation &mdash; just wanting the person you love to be where they truly belong, even if it's not with you.</p>

        <h3>4. The small moments are the big moments</h3>

        <p>The movie's most powerful revelation is that Joan doesn't miss the dramatic, cinematic love story. She misses the mundane. The library. The car rides. The bickering. That ordinary Tuesday afternoon when nothing remarkable happened but everything felt exactly right. It reminded me to stop waiting for the grand gestures and start appreciating the quiet ones.</p>

        <div class="pull-quote">Forever is just another way of saying every single day, together. And that's the most romantic thing I've ever heard a movie say.</div>

        <h3>5. You arrive at the afterlife as the version of yourself from your happiest time</h3>

        <p>This detail is small but it stuck with me. Your appearance in the Junction reflects when you were happiest. It made me think &mdash; if I arrived tomorrow, what version of me would show up? Am I living in a way where my happiest chapter is now, or am I still waiting for it to start? That's a question worth asking yourself while you're still alive to do something about it.</p>

        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

        <p>Eternity is warm, clever, funny, and surprisingly deep. Elizabeth Olsen is phenomenal &mdash; she carries the emotional weight of the whole film without it ever feeling heavy. Miles Teller brings this grounded, lovable energy that makes you root for Larry from the start. And Callum Turner plays Luke with such tenderness that you understand completely why Joan loved him too.</p>

        <p>It's the kind of movie that makes you want to text your person. Or hug your pillow. Or sit quietly and think about what love means to you right now, at this exact stage of your life. I watched it alone on my couch on a random weeknight, and it was genuinely one of the best movie nights I've had in a while.</p>

        <p><strong>My rating:</strong> 8.5/10 &mdash; Would absolutely watch again. Preferably with tea, a blanket, and someone to hold my hand during the ending.</p>

        <p>If you've seen it, come talk to me about it. Did you team Larry or team Luke? And if you haven't watched it yet &mdash; what are you waiting for? Go press play.</p>
