        <p class="post-intro">There was a time when my mornings looked like frantic alarm-snoozing, rushing through getting ready, and heading out the door already feeling behind. I was anxious before my day even started. Then I discovered something that completely transformed not just my mornings, but my entire life &mdash; a morning devotional practice. And honestly? It's the best decision I've ever made.</p>

        <h2>Why I Started</h2>
        <p>Let me be real with you &mdash; I was going through one of the most significant transitions of my life. I was settling into a new career as a network engineer, navigating friendships that were shifting, and battling this persistent anxiety that sat in my chest like a stone. Everything felt unfamiliar. I was going to church on Sundays, yes, but the peace I felt there would evaporate by Monday morning.</p>
        <p>One night I couldn't sleep, and I found myself scrolling through the Bible app on my phone. I'd downloaded it ages ago but barely used it. I tapped on a devotional plan called something like "Peace in Uncertain Times" &mdash; and the first verse hit me so hard I had to put my phone down and just breathe. It was like God was speaking directly into the exact thing I was going through.</p>
        <p>That night, I set my alarm for 4 AM and decided I'd try something different. That first morning was messy. I couldn't focus during prayer, and I kept getting distracted. But something small shifted inside me. There was a quietness I hadn't felt in months. So I tried again the next day. And the next. And now, I haven't stopped.</p>

        <h2>My Morning Devotional Routine</h2>
        <p>My routine has evolved a lot since those early days, but here's what a typical morning looks like now. It takes about 45 minutes to an hour, and it's genuinely my favorite part of the day.</p>

        <h3>4:00 AM &mdash; Wake Up and Settle In</h3>
        <p>Yes, 4 AM. I know it sounds wild, but hear me out. At 4 AM, the world is completely still. No notifications, no emails from work, no noise. It's just me and God in the dark quiet of the morning. I wash my face, grab a glass of warm water, and settle into my favorite corner &mdash; a little spot where I've placed a cushion, a candle, and my journal. The house is silent and it feels sacred, like the world hasn't started demanding anything of me yet.</p>

        <h3>4:10 AM &mdash; The Bible App</h3>
        <p>This is the heart of my devotional, and I cannot overstate how much the Bible app changed my life. During my transition &mdash; new career, new routines, new version of myself &mdash; it was the one constant that kept me grounded. I follow their devotional plans, and the way they break down scripture with daily reflections makes it so accessible. Right now I'm going through a plan on the Psalms, and before that I did one on identity in Christ that absolutely wrecked me (in the best way).</p>
        <p>I read slowly, usually just one devotional entry and the connected scripture. I'm not trying to speed-read through the Bible. I want to actually absorb what I'm reading. I highlight verses that speak to me, save them in the app, and sometimes screenshot them for my lock screen. There's something about having a verse staring back at you every time you check your phone that keeps you anchored throughout the day.</p>

        <h3>4:30 AM &mdash; Journaling</h3>
        <p>This is where things get personal. I write down what stood out to me from the reading, what I feel God is saying to me, and what's on my heart. Some days it's a full page of thoughts, other days it's three lines. I also write down things I'm grateful for &mdash; a problem I solved at work, a good conversation with a friend, the fact that I'm healthy and breathing. Gratitude journaling alongside devotional journaling has been a game changer for my mindset, especially on days when network issues have me stressed before the sun is even up.</p>

        <h3>4:45 AM &mdash; Prayer</h3>
        <p>I end with prayer, and this is the part that has grown the most. I used to treat prayer like a to-do list &mdash; bless my family, help me at work, amen. Now it's a conversation. I talk to God about my fears, my dreams, the things I'm struggling with. I pray for my family, for my friends, for situations I've seen in the news. I also sit in silence for a few minutes, just listening. Some of my biggest moments of clarity have come in those quiet minutes.</p>

        <h3>5:00 AM &mdash; Worship and Getting Ready</h3>
        <p>This is where the transition happens &mdash; from stillness to movement, from devotional Roberta to network-engineer Roberta. I put on worship music and it stays on while I get ready for work. Sinach, Nathaniel Bassey, Maverick City Music, sometimes Bethel. The worship carries the peace from my devotional straight into my morning routine. I'm doing my skincare, picking out my outfit, packing my bag &mdash; but the atmosphere is still holy. By the time I walk out the door, I feel covered. Protected. Ready.</p>
        <p>There's something powerful about walking into a room full of routers, switches, and server racks with worship still echoing in your spirit. My colleagues don't know it, but by the time I sit down at my desk, I've already had the most important meeting of my day.</p>

        <h2>Bible Verses That Ground Me</h2>
        <p>Over time, certain verses have become anchors for me. I come back to them again and again, especially on hard days:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Philippians 4:6-7</strong> &mdash; "Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus." This verse literally changed how I handle anxiety.</li>
          <li><strong>Psalm 46:10</strong> &mdash; "Be still, and know that I am God." Simple. Powerful. A reminder that I don't have to figure everything out.</li>
          <li><strong>Isaiah 26:3</strong> &mdash; "You will keep in perfect peace those whose minds are steadfast, because they trust in you." This one I have written on a sticky note on my mirror.</li>
          <li><strong>Jeremiah 29:11</strong> &mdash; "For I know the plans I have for you, declares the Lord, plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future." This one carried me through every uncertain moment of my transition.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How It Changed Me</h2>
        <p>The transformation wasn't overnight, but it was undeniable. Within the first month, I noticed I was less reactive. Things that would have sent me spiraling &mdash; a critical outage at work, an unexpected challenge, a stressful commute &mdash; started to feel more manageable. I had a foundation of peace that the chaos couldn't shake.</p>
        <p>My anxiety didn't disappear completely (I'm human, after all), but it lost its grip on me. I started sleeping better. I became sharper at work because I wasn't spending the first hour of my day in a mental fog &mdash; and trust me, in network engineering, you need to be sharp. My relationships improved because I was showing up as a calmer, more present version of myself.</p>
        <p>The Bible app was genuinely instrumental in my transition. When everything around me was changing &mdash; new career, new identity, new pace of life &mdash; the daily devotionals gave me something consistent to hold onto. It was like God was meeting me exactly where I was, every single morning, through that little app on my phone. I know that sounds simple, but sometimes the simplest tools are the ones God uses the most.</p>
        <p>The most beautiful part? I started to hear God more clearly. Not in an audible voice, but in nudges, in peace about certain decisions, in scripture that seemed to speak directly to whatever I was going through. It's like tuning into a radio frequency &mdash; the more consistently you show up, the clearer the signal becomes.</p>

        <h2>Tips for Starting Your Own Devotional</h2>
        <p>If you're thinking about starting a morning devotional practice, here's what I'd tell you &mdash; as a friend, not as someone who has it all figured out:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Start small</strong> &mdash; You don't need an hour. Start with 10 minutes. Open the Bible app, pick a short devotional plan, and just read one day's entry. Build from there.</li>
          <li><strong>Be consistent, not perfect</strong> &mdash; There are mornings I oversleep past 4 AM. Mornings when my mind won't stop racing about work. Mornings when I just sit there and cry. It all counts. Just show up.</li>
          <li><strong>Create a space</strong> &mdash; It doesn't have to be fancy. A corner of your room, a spot on the couch, even your car before you drive to work. Having a designated space signals to your brain that it's time to be still.</li>
          <li><strong>Download the Bible app</strong> &mdash; Seriously. The YouVersion Bible app is free and it has devotional plans for everything &mdash; anxiety, purpose, transitions, relationships, identity. It takes the guesswork out of "what do I even read?" and it's how I started my entire journey.</li>
          <li><strong>Let worship carry you</strong> &mdash; Even if you don't have time for a full devotional, put on a worship playlist while you get ready. Let the atmosphere shift around you. You'd be surprised how much that alone can change the tone of your entire day.</li>
          <li><strong>Give yourself grace</strong> &mdash; You won't feel a breakthrough every morning. Some days it will feel routine. That's okay. Faithfulness in the mundane is still faithfulness.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>My morning devotional isn't just a routine &mdash; it's a lifeline. It's the reason I can walk into a high-pressure work environment with a settled heart. It's the reason I can navigate transitions without falling apart. It's the reason I know, deep in my bones, that I am loved, held, and guided by a God who never leaves.</p>
        <p>If you're in a season of change, anxiety, or just feeling disconnected &mdash; I want you to know that peace is available to you. Not the kind the world offers, which is temporary and conditional. The kind that comes from sitting at the feet of Jesus at 4 AM, with nothing but a candle and the Bible app open on your phone.</p>
        <p>Try it for a week. That's all I ask. Set your alarm, open the app, and just be still. You might be surprised at what happens.</p>
