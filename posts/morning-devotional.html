        <p class="post-intro">There was a time when my mornings looked like frantic alarm-snoozing, rushing through breakfast, and heading out the door already feeling behind. I was anxious before my day even started. Then I discovered something that completely transformed not just my mornings, but my entire life &mdash; a morning devotional practice. And honestly? It's the best decision I've ever made.</p>

        <h2>Why I Started</h2>
        <p>Let me be real with you &mdash; 2024 was one of the hardest years of my life. I was navigating career uncertainty, dealing with friendships that were shifting, and battling this persistent anxiety that sat in my chest like a stone. I'd wake up at 3 AM with racing thoughts, unable to fall back asleep. I was going to church on Sundays, yes, but the peace I felt there would evaporate by Monday morning.</p>
        <p>One evening, my mum called me &mdash; the way only Ghanaian mothers do, with that mix of concern and gentle scolding. She said, "Roberta, when was the last time you sat with God? Not in church. Not in a rush. Just sat with Him?" I didn't have an answer. That night, I set my alarm for 5:30 AM and decided I'd try something different.</p>
        <p>That first morning was messy. I didn't know what to read, I couldn't focus during prayer, and I kept checking my phone. But something small shifted inside me. There was a quietness I hadn't felt in months. So I tried again the next day. And the next. And now, over a year later, I haven't stopped.</p>

        <h2>My Morning Devotional Routine</h2>
        <p>My routine has evolved a lot since those early days, but here's what a typical morning looks like now. It takes about 45 minutes to an hour, and it's genuinely my favorite part of the day.</p>

        <h3>5:30 AM &mdash; Wake Up and Settle In</h3>
        <p>I wake up before the Accra traffic noise starts, before the roosters in our neighborhood begin their chorus, before the world demands anything of me. I don't check my phone (it stays on airplane mode from the night before). I wash my face, grab a glass of warm water with lemon, and settle into my favorite corner of my room &mdash; a little spot by the window where I've placed a cushion and a small side table with my Bible, journal, and a candle.</p>

        <h3>5:40 AM &mdash; Worship Music</h3>
        <p>I start with worship music. Not loud, not performative &mdash; just soft and intimate. I have a playlist that includes songs by Sinach, Nathaniel Bassey, and Maverick City Music. Sometimes I sing along, sometimes I just sit and let the music wash over me. This is the part where I transition from "sleepy Roberta" to someone who is present and ready to receive. There's something about worship in the quiet dawn hours that feels like a private conversation between me and God.</p>

        <h3>5:50 AM &mdash; Bible Reading</h3>
        <p>I follow a reading plan &mdash; right now I'm going through the book of Psalms alongside the Gospel of John. I read slowly, usually just one chapter or even a few verses. I'm not trying to speed-read through the Bible. I want to actually absorb what I'm reading. I'll often read a passage two or three times, each time noticing something new. I highlight verses that speak to me and write them in the margin of my Bible. My Bible is full of dates and little notes now &mdash; it's become a journal of its own.</p>

        <h3>6:10 AM &mdash; Journaling</h3>
        <p>This is where things get personal. I write down what stood out to me from the reading, what I feel God is saying to me, and what's on my heart. Some days it's a full page of thoughts, other days it's three lines. I also write down things I'm grateful for &mdash; the harmattan breeze that finally cooled down the city, a kind word from a friend, the fact that the trotro wasn't packed that morning. Gratitude journaling alongside devotional journaling has been a game changer for my mindset.</p>

        <h3>6:25 AM &mdash; Prayer</h3>
        <p>I end with prayer, and this is the part that has grown the most. I used to treat prayer like a to-do list &mdash; bless my family, help me at work, amen. Now it's a conversation. I talk to God about my fears, my dreams, the things I'm struggling with. I pray for my family in Kumasi, for my friends, for Ghana, for situations I've seen in the news. I also sit in silence for a few minutes, just listening. Some of my biggest moments of clarity have come in those quiet minutes.</p>

        <h2>Bible Verses That Ground Me</h2>
        <p>Over the past year, certain verses have become anchors for me. I come back to them again and again, especially on hard days:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Philippians 4:6-7</strong> &mdash; "Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus." This verse literally changed how I handle anxiety.</li>
          <li><strong>Psalm 46:10</strong> &mdash; "Be still, and know that I am God." Simple. Powerful. A reminder that I don't have to figure everything out.</li>
          <li><strong>Isaiah 26:3</strong> &mdash; "You will keep in perfect peace those whose minds are steadfast, because they trust in you." This one I have written on a sticky note on my mirror.</li>
          <li><strong>Lamentations 3:22-23</strong> &mdash; "Because of the Lord's great love we are not consumed, for his compassions never fail. They are new every morning; great is your faithfulness." New every morning &mdash; just like my devotional.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How It Changed Me</h2>
        <p>The transformation wasn't overnight, but it was undeniable. Within the first month, I noticed I was less reactive. Things that would have sent me spiraling &mdash; a rude email, an unexpected bill, traffic on the Tema motorway &mdash; started to feel more manageable. I had a foundation of peace that the chaos couldn't shake.</p>
        <p>My anxiety didn't disappear completely (I'm human, after all), but it lost its grip on me. I started sleeping better. I became more productive at work because I wasn't spending the first hour of my day in a mental fog. My relationships improved because I was showing up as a calmer, more present version of myself.</p>
        <p>The most beautiful part? I started to hear God more clearly. Not in an audible voice, but in nudges, in peace about certain decisions, in scripture that seemed to speak directly to whatever I was going through. It's like tuning into a radio frequency &mdash; the more consistently you show up, the clearer the signal becomes.</p>

        <h2>Tips for Starting Your Own Devotional</h2>
        <p>If you're thinking about starting a morning devotional practice, here's what I'd tell you &mdash; as a friend, not as someone who has it all figured out:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Start small</strong> &mdash; You don't need an hour. Start with 10 minutes. Read one Psalm, write one sentence, say one prayer. Build from there.</li>
          <li><strong>Be consistent, not perfect</strong> &mdash; There are mornings I oversleep. Mornings when my mind won't stop racing. Mornings when I just sit there and cry. It all counts. Just show up.</li>
          <li><strong>Create a space</strong> &mdash; It doesn't have to be fancy. A corner of your room, a spot on the couch, even your car before you drive to work. Having a designated space signals to your brain that it's time to be still.</li>
          <li><strong>Put your phone away</strong> &mdash; Airplane mode is your best friend. Instagram and WhatsApp messages can wait. This time is sacred.</li>
          <li><strong>Find a reading plan</strong> &mdash; If you don't know where to start, try the YouVersion Bible app. They have devotional plans for everything &mdash; anxiety, purpose, relationships, identity. It takes the guesswork out of it.</li>
          <li><strong>Give yourself grace</strong> &mdash; You won't feel a breakthrough every morning. Some days it will feel routine. That's okay. Faithfulness in the mundane is still faithfulness.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>My morning devotional isn't just a routine &mdash; it's a lifeline. It's the reason I can face a chaotic day with a settled heart. It's the reason I can navigate uncertainty without falling apart. It's the reason I know, deep in my bones, that I am loved, held, and guided by a God who never leaves.</p>
        <p>If you're in a season of chaos, anxiety, or just feeling disconnected &mdash; I want you to know that peace is available to you. Not the kind the world offers, which is temporary and conditional. The kind that comes from sitting at the feet of Jesus, even for just a few minutes each morning.</p>
        <p>Try it for a week. That's all I ask. Set your alarm, open your Bible, and just be still. You might be surprised at what happens.</p>
