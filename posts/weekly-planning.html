        <p class="post-intro">I used to start every Monday morning in survival mode. I'd open my laptop, see a wall of emails and network tickets, glance at my empty Google Calendar, and feel instantly overwhelmed. Between work, trying to get to the gym, Accra traffic, devotionals, and somehow having a life &mdash; it was pure chaos. Then I started planning my weeks intentionally, and honestly? It changed everything. Let me show you exactly how I do it.</p>

        <h2>My Sunday Planning Ritual</h2>
        <p>Every Sunday evening, usually around 7 PM after church, I sit down for what I call my "weekly reset." I make a cup of tea, light a candle, put on some soft worship music, and spend about 45 minutes mapping out the entire week ahead on Google Calendar. It's become one of my favorite rituals &mdash; it calms my mind and helps me enter Monday morning with clarity instead of that familiar dread.</p>
        <p>I start by reviewing the past week. What did I accomplish? What got carried over? What can I let go of entirely? As a network engineer, my weeks can be unpredictable &mdash; an outage can blow up a perfectly planned Tuesday, a last-minute maintenance window can eat your entire Wednesday evening. So this reflection piece is important because it helps me be realistic about what actually fits in a week, not what I <em>wish</em> would fit.</p>

        <h2>Google Calendar Is My Entire Life</h2>
        <p>I'm not exaggerating. If it's not on Google Calendar, it doesn't exist. I've tried physical planners, Notion, Trello &mdash; they all fell off after two weeks. But Google Calendar? It's on my phone, my laptop, my work computer. It syncs everywhere, it sends me reminders, and the color-coding is *chef's kiss*.</p>
        <p>Here's how I color-code my life:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Red &mdash; Work (Network Engineering)</strong> &mdash; Meetings, maintenance windows, on-call shifts, project deadlines. This is the non-negotiable backbone of my calendar and everything else works around it.</li>
          <li><strong>Green &mdash; Gym &amp; Fitness</strong> &mdash; Workout sessions, rest days, anything body-related. If it's not blocked in green, Accra traffic will swallow that gym time whole. More on this later.</li>
          <li><strong>Blue &mdash; Faith &amp; Devotion</strong> &mdash; My 4 AM devotional, church on Sunday, Bible app plans. This is the foundation everything else is built on.</li>
          <li><strong>Pink &mdash; Blog &amp; Content</strong> &mdash; Writing posts, editing photos, social media. Yes, this blog has its own color. She deserves it.</li>
          <li><strong>Yellow &mdash; Personal &amp; Social</strong> &mdash; Friend dates, errands, self-care, The Office rewatch nights. Because if your calendar doesn't include joy, what's the point?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When I look at my week and see a healthy mix of colors, I know I'm balanced. When it's all red with barely any green or yellow? That's my cue to protect my time before I burn out.</p>

        <h2>A Day in My Life: The Realistic Version</h2>
        <p>I could give you the "ideal" schedule, but let me give you the real one &mdash; the one that includes Accra traffic, surprise work escalations, and the gym battle.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>4:00 &ndash; 5:00 AM</strong> &mdash; Devotional time. Bible app, journaling, prayer, worship. This is sacred. The world is still asleep and it's just me and God. Nothing touches this hour.</li>
          <li><strong>5:00 &ndash; 5:45 AM</strong> &mdash; Get ready for work. Worship music stays on while I do my skincare and get dressed. The transition from devotional mode to work mode happens through worship &mdash; it keeps the peace going.</li>
          <li><strong>5:45 &ndash; 7:00 AM</strong> &mdash; The commute. And listen &mdash; if you've never sat in Accra rush hour traffic, you don't know stress. Spintex Road alone can add 45 minutes to your morning. I've learned to leave early, and I use the drive time for podcasts or worship music. Fighting traffic while angry is a losing game, so I've made it productive time instead.</li>
          <li><strong>7:00 AM &ndash; 4:00 PM</strong> &mdash; Work. Configuring networks, troubleshooting, monitoring, meetings, tickets, the occasional "everything is down" fire drill. Some days are smooth, some days you're staring at CLI outputs for hours trying to find where a route went wrong. Google Calendar keeps my meetings and deadlines visible so nothing falls through the cracks.</li>
          <li><strong>4:00 &ndash; 5:30 PM</strong> &mdash; The commute home. Yes, another hour-plus in traffic. This is where the gym battle begins (more on this below).</li>
          <li><strong>5:30 &ndash; 7:00 PM</strong> &mdash; Gym time (on gym days) or personal time &mdash; blog writing, errands, rest.</li>
          <li><strong>7:00 &ndash; 9:00 PM</strong> &mdash; Dinner, reading, wind down. Phone goes on Do Not Disturb by 9 PM because that 4 AM alarm is not playing.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Gym Battle (Let's Be Honest)</h2>
        <p>Getting to the gym as a working professional in Accra is a full-on strategic operation. Between work hours and traffic, there's this tiny window where going to the gym is actually possible &mdash; and it requires planning it like a military mission.</p>
        <p>Here's what I've learned:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Block it in Google Calendar or it won't happen.</strong> I literally create a recurring event &mdash; "GYM" in green &mdash; for the days I plan to go. If it's not blocked, something else will fill that slot. Every. Single. Time.</li>
          <li><strong>Pack your gym bag the night before.</strong> If I have to come home, sit down, and then try to motivate myself to pack and leave again? It's over. The couch wins. But if my bag is already in the car, I can go straight from work.</li>
          <li><strong>Be realistic about frequency.</strong> I aim for 3-4 gym days a week. Some weeks I hit all four. Some weeks traffic and work conspire against me, and I get two. I've stopped beating myself up about it. Two is better than zero.</li>
          <li><strong>Find a gym on your route.</strong> This was a game-changer. Instead of going home first and then to the gym (adding another round of traffic), I found a gym that's between work and home. It cuts out the "I'm too tired to go back out" excuse entirely.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The truth is, the gym isn't just about fitness for me. It's my stress release. After a day of troubleshooting network issues, there's something therapeutic about putting on my headphones and lifting heavy things. It's the one place where nobody's asking me about bandwidth or packet loss.</p>

        <h2>How Google Calendar Saves Me From Myself</h2>
        <p>I have a tendency to overcommit. I'll say yes to everything &mdash; a friend's birthday dinner, a blog collaboration, an extra shift, helping someone with their Wi-Fi setup &mdash; until suddenly my week is packed to the ceiling and I have zero breathing room.</p>
        <p>Google Calendar fixed that. Now, before I say yes to anything, I check my calendar first. If the week is already heavy on red (work) and light on yellow (personal), I know I need to protect my downtime. It's not about being rigid &mdash; it's about being honest with myself about what I can actually handle.</p>
        <p>A few Google Calendar tricks that changed my life:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Set reminders for everything</strong> &mdash; 30-minute reminders before gym sessions, 1-day reminders before deadlines. My memory is good, but Accra traffic can make you forget your own name.</li>
          <li><strong>Use "Focus Time" blocks</strong> &mdash; I block 1-2 hours of "Focus Time" during work for deep tasks that need concentration. No meetings, no interruptions. Just me and the terminal.</li>
          <li><strong>Schedule travel time</strong> &mdash; I add buffer blocks for commuting. A 4 PM meeting doesn't mean I'm free at 4:30 &mdash; it means I'm sitting in traffic at 4:30. The calendar needs to reflect reality, not fantasy.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>My Non-Negotiables</h2>
        <p>These are the things that happen every single week, no matter what. They go into Google Calendar first, before anything else:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>4 AM devotional</strong> &mdash; Every day, no exceptions. This is the anchor of my life.</li>
          <li><strong>Gym 3-4x per week</strong> &mdash; Blocked in green. Pre-packed gym bag. No excuses (unless traffic is truly demonic that day).</li>
          <li><strong>Sunday rest</strong> &mdash; Church, food, rest, planning. I don't work on Sundays. My soul needs the recharge.</li>
          <li><strong>Reading before bed</strong> &mdash; At least 20-30 minutes. It's how I wind down and it feeds my mind.</li>
          <li><strong>One blog post per week</strong> &mdash; Consistency is what grows a blog. Even when work is crazy, I find the time. Usually Sunday afternoon or a quiet weeknight.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Navigating Life in Accra</h2>
        <p>I feel like I need a whole section on this because if you live in Accra, you know. The traffic isn't just an inconvenience &mdash; it's a lifestyle. It shapes when you leave, when you arrive, what you can fit into your day, and how much energy you have left by the time you get home.</p>
        <p>Here's how I've made peace with it:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Leave early, always.</strong> My 4 AM wake-up means I beat the worst of the morning rush. By the time the madness starts on Spintex or the motorway, I'm already at my desk.</li>
          <li><strong>Turn commute time into growth time.</strong> Podcasts, audiobooks, worship playlists, prayer. The car is my second devotional space. Some of my best ideas for this blog have come while sitting in traffic.</li>
          <li><strong>Don't plan back-to-back things on opposite sides of the city.</strong> This sounds obvious but I've learned the hard way. A meeting in East Legon followed by dinner in Osu at 6 PM? Not happening. Google Calendar helps me see these conflicts before I commit.</li>
          <li><strong>Give yourself grace on traffic days.</strong> Some days, the traffic wins. You miss the gym. You get home later than planned. Dinner is simpler than you wanted. That's Accra. You adjust, you breathe, you try again tomorrow.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>Planning isn't about controlling every minute of your life. It's about being intentional with the time God has given you &mdash; even when that time includes two hours of traffic, surprise network outages, and a gym session that almost didn't happen. It's about making sure the things that matter most &mdash; your faith, your health, your relationships, your dreams &mdash; actually get space in your week instead of being swallowed by whatever feels most urgent in the moment.</p>
        <p>Your week is going to happen whether you plan it or not. Google Calendar is free. Color-code your life. Block your gym time. Leave early for traffic. And start every single morning with God before the chaos begins.</p>
