        <p class="post-intro">I used to start every Monday morning in a panic. I'd open my laptop, stare at my to-do list, and feel instantly overwhelmed by everything I needed to do &mdash; blog posts to write, content to plan, workouts to schedule, Bible study to keep up with, a business to build. It was chaos. Then I started planning my weeks intentionally, and honestly? It changed everything. Let me show you exactly how I do it.</p>

        <h2>My Sunday Planning Ritual</h2>
        <p>Every Sunday evening, usually around 7 PM after church and dinner, I sit down for what I call my "weekly reset." I make a cup of tea (currently obsessed with honey and lemon), light a candle, put on some soft worship music, and spend about 45 minutes planning the entire week ahead. It's become one of my favorite rituals &mdash; it calms my mind and helps me enter the week with clarity instead of chaos.</p>
        <p>I start by reviewing the past week. What did I accomplish? What got carried over? What can I let go of entirely? This reflection piece is important because it prevents the never-ending to-do list syndrome where tasks just pile up week after week without ever being evaluated. Some things that felt urgent last Monday genuinely don't matter by Sunday, and that's okay.</p>

        <h2>The Tools I Use</h2>
        <p>I've tried so many planners and apps, and honestly, I've landed on a hybrid system that works beautifully for me:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>A physical weekly planner</strong> &mdash; I use a simple, undated planner with a weekly spread. There's something about writing things by hand that makes them feel more real and helps me remember them. I use different colored pens for different categories (more on that below).</li>
          <li><strong>Google Calendar</strong> &mdash; For time-blocking and appointments. I color-code everything so I can see at a glance how my week is balanced. If my calendar is all one color, something is off.</li>
          <li><strong>Notes app on my phone</strong> &mdash; For quick brain dumps throughout the week. Whenever a random task or idea pops into my head, I jot it here so it doesn't live rent-free in my brain. During Sunday planning, I sort through these notes and assign them to the right day.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How I Categorize My Tasks</h2>
        <p>This was the game-changer for me. Instead of writing one massive to-do list, I break everything into five categories. Each category gets its own color in my planner:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Blog &amp; Content (pink)</strong> &mdash; Writing posts, editing photos, scheduling social media, engaging with my community, brainstorming ideas.</li>
          <li><strong>Business (purple)</strong> &mdash; Emails, collaborations, brand partnerships, financial tracking, strategy planning. Balancing blogging with entrepreneurship means both need dedicated space.</li>
          <li><strong>Fitness &amp; Health (green)</strong> &mdash; Workout sessions, meal prep, grocery shopping, rest days. Yes, rest days are scheduled. They're not optional.</li>
          <li><strong>Faith &amp; Growth (blue)</strong> &mdash; Bible study, devotionals, church commitments, journaling, books I'm reading. This is the foundation everything else is built on.</li>
          <li><strong>Personal &amp; Fun (orange)</strong> &mdash; Friend dates, family time, self-care, hobbies, Netflix nights. Because if your planner doesn't include joy, what's the point?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When I look at my weekly spread and see a healthy mix of colors, I know my week is balanced. When it's dominated by one color (usually pink or purple, if I'm being honest), I know I need to redistribute and make room for the other areas of my life.</p>

        <h2>Time-Blocking: My Secret Weapon</h2>
        <p>I time-block every weekday in 2-hour chunks. Here's what a typical day looks like for me:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>5:30 &ndash; 6:30 AM</strong> &mdash; Morning devotional, prayer, journaling. This is sacred time and nothing touches it.</li>
          <li><strong>6:30 &ndash; 7:30 AM</strong> &mdash; Workout or walk.</li>
          <li><strong>8:00 &ndash; 10:00 AM</strong> &mdash; Deep work block. This is when I write blog posts, work on big projects, or do anything that requires serious focus. Phone goes on Do Not Disturb.</li>
          <li><strong>10:00 &ndash; 12:00 PM</strong> &mdash; Business tasks &mdash; emails, calls, admin work.</li>
          <li><strong>12:00 &ndash; 1:00 PM</strong> &mdash; Lunch and rest. I actually eat away from my desk and take a real break.</li>
          <li><strong>1:00 &ndash; 3:00 PM</strong> &mdash; Content creation &mdash; photos, social media, engagement.</li>
          <li><strong>3:00 &ndash; 5:00 PM</strong> &mdash; Flexible block for overflow tasks, personal errands, or creative projects.</li>
          <li><strong>Evening</strong> &mdash; Personal time. Dinner, reading, family, rest.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The beauty of time-blocking is that it removes decision fatigue. I don't waste mental energy wondering what to do next because it's already decided. I just look at my calendar and execute.</p>

        <h2>My Non-Negotiables</h2>
        <p>These are the things that happen every single week, no matter how busy I am. They're blocked in my calendar first, before anything else:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Morning devotional</strong> &mdash; Every day, no exceptions. Even if it's just 15 minutes, I start with God.</li>
          <li><strong>Movement</strong> &mdash; At least 4 days of intentional exercise. My body and mind need it.</li>
          <li><strong>One blog post</strong> &mdash; Consistency is what grows a blog. One post, every single week.</li>
          <li><strong>Sabbath rest</strong> &mdash; Sunday is for church, family, and rest. I don't work on Sundays (except the evening planning session, which honestly feels more like self-care than work).</li>
          <li><strong>Reading</strong> &mdash; At least 30 minutes a day. It feeds my mind and my creativity.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How I Handle Overwhelm</h2>
        <p>Even with the best planning system, overwhelm still creeps in. Here's what I do when it hits:</p>
        <p>First, I stop and breathe. Literally. Three deep breaths. It sounds too simple to work, but it interrupts the panic spiral every time.</p>
        <p>Then I look at my list and ask myself: <em>"What are the three most important things today?"</em> Not ten. Not seven. Three. I circle those three things and give myself permission to let the rest wait. Nine times out of ten, the world doesn't end because I didn't answer that email until tomorrow.</p>
        <p>I also give myself grace. I used to beat myself up on Fridays if I didn't complete everything on my list. Now I celebrate what I <em>did</em> accomplish instead of fixating on what I didn't. Progress over perfection, always.</p>

        <h2>Advice for Busy Women Who Want to Be More Intentional</h2>
        <p>If you're reading this feeling like your weeks just happen <em>to</em> you instead of <em>for</em> you, here are a few things I'd say:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Start small</strong> &mdash; You don't need a perfect system on day one. Start by writing down your top 3 priorities for tomorrow. That's it. Build from there.</li>
          <li><strong>Plan on paper first</strong> &mdash; There's something powerful about physically writing your plans. It engages your brain differently than typing.</li>
          <li><strong>Protect your mornings</strong> &mdash; However your morning starts sets the tone for everything. Guard that time fiercely.</li>
          <li><strong>Say no more often</strong> &mdash; Every yes to something is a no to something else. Be intentional about what gets your energy.</li>
          <li><strong>Include rest in your plan</strong> &mdash; Rest is not lazy. Rest is productive. Schedule it like you would a meeting.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>Planning isn't about controlling every minute of your life. It's about being intentional with the time God has given you. It's about making sure the things that matter most &mdash; your faith, your health, your relationships, your dreams &mdash; actually get space in your week instead of being pushed aside by whatever feels most urgent in the moment.</p>
        <p>Your week is going to happen whether you plan it or not. Why not make it happen on your terms?</p>
