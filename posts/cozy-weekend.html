        <p class="post-intro">Some weekends are for going out, being social, and doing All The Things. But some weekends? Some weekends are for staying in, wearing your softest pajamas, and pretending the outside world doesn't exist. This is a list for <em>those</em> weekends. Here are ten of my favorite cozy things to do when I just need to recharge.</p>

        <h2>1. Rewatch The Office (For the Hundredth Time)</h2>
        <p>I am not exaggerating when I say The Office is my emotional support show. When life gets overwhelming, there is nothing more comforting than returning to Dunder Mifflin. I'll curl up under my blanket, make some popcorn, and let Michael Scott remind me of what's really important in life. As the man himself once said: <em>"Would I rather be feared or loved? Easy. Both. I want people to be afraid of how much they love me."</em> Iconic. I usually start from Season 2 (hot take: Season 1 is a bit rough) and let it play in the background while I do everything else on this list.</p>

        <h2>2. Bake Banana Bread</h2>
        <p>There is something deeply therapeutic about baking banana bread. The smell alone is enough to make your whole apartment feel like a hug. I use the simplest recipe &mdash; overripe bananas, flour, sugar, butter, an egg, and a pinch of cinnamon. No fancy equipment needed. I always add chocolate chips because life is too short for plain banana bread. The best part is eating a warm slice with butter while it's still fresh from the oven. Absolute heaven.</p>

        <h2>3. Journal with a Cup of Tea</h2>
        <p>Grab your prettiest mug, brew some herbal tea (I love chamomile or Lipton with a touch of honey &mdash; very Ghanaian of me), and sit down with your journal. You don't have to write anything profound. Brain dump your thoughts, make lists of things you're grateful for, write down your goals for the next week, or just doodle in the margins. There's something about putting pen to paper that clears the mental clutter in a way that typing on your phone never can.</p>

        <h2>4. At-Home Spa Night</h2>
        <p>This is my love language. Light some candles, put on your favorite playlist (more on that later), and give yourself the full treatment. I'm talking face mask, body scrub, deep conditioning hair treatment, painted nails &mdash; the works. I like to use a honey and oatmeal face mask that I make myself, and I always finish with my richest body butter. You'll go to bed feeling like a brand new person. Bonus points if you put cucumber slices on your eyes. Yes, it actually works. Yes, you will feel like a queen.</p>

        <h2>5. Read a Good Book</h2>
        <p>Put down your phone (I know, I know) and pick up an actual book. There's something different about holding a physical book &mdash; the texture of the pages, the smell, the satisfaction of seeing your bookmark move forward. Right now I'm reading <em>Becoming</em> by Michelle Obama for the second time, and it hits differently every time. If you want something lighter, I always recommend anything by Jasmine Guillory for the perfect cozy romance. Find a comfy spot, tuck your legs under a blanket, and disappear into someone else's world for a while.</p>

        <h2>6. Take a Slow Walk</h2>
        <p>Not a power walk. Not exercise. Just a slow, intentional walk around your neighborhood. Leave your headphones at home (revolutionary, I know) and just notice things &mdash; the trees, the sky, the way the light falls in the late afternoon. I love walking around my area in Accra in the early evening when the heat has died down and the sky turns that gorgeous dusty pink. Wave at the aunties sitting outside. Pet the neighborhood dog. Buy roasted plantain from the street vendor. It's simple, it's free, and it does wonders for your mood.</p>

        <h2>7. Rearrange Your Room</h2>
        <p>Okay, hear me out. There is no quicker way to feel like you have a brand new life than rearranging your furniture. Move your bed to a different wall, reorganize your bookshelf, change the layout of your desk. It costs absolutely nothing but it makes your space feel completely fresh. I do this at least once every two months, and my roommate thinks I'm unhinged, but the serotonin boost is real. Clean sheets, rearranged furniture, a freshly made bed &mdash; suddenly your room is a sanctuary again.</p>

        <h2>8. Cook a Ghanaian Comfort Meal</h2>
        <p>For me, the ultimate comfort food is jollof rice. I'm not talking about the quick weeknight version &mdash; I mean the full, slow-cooked, Sunday-afternoon jollof with perfectly smoky party rice vibes. The kind where you use fresh tomatoes and blend your own pepper. I'll put on some highlife music, take my time with the cooking, and make enough to have leftovers for days. I usually pair it with fried plantain and some peppered chicken. The whole process of cooking it is as comforting as eating it &mdash; stirring the pot, adjusting the seasoning, waiting for the rice to steam just right. It's meditative, honestly.</p>

        <h2>9. Create a New Playlist</h2>
        <p>There's an art to making a playlist, and a cozy weekend is the perfect time to curate one. I like to make playlists for specific moods &mdash; "Sunday Morning Slow," "Golden Hour Vibes," "Late Night Thoughts." I'll spend an hour going down a Spotify rabbit hole, discovering new artists, and rediscovering old favorites. Right now my cozy playlist has a mix of Jorja Smith, Amaarae, Daniel Caesar, and some old-school Celine Dion (no judgment, please). A good playlist can literally change the energy of your entire home.</p>

        <h2>10. Have a Phone-Free Evening</h2>
        <p>This one is the hardest but the most rewarding. After 7 PM, put your phone in a drawer. Not on silent &mdash; actually put it away where you can't see it or reach for it. No scrolling through Twitter, no mindless Instagram stories, no falling into TikTok loops until midnight. Instead, do any of the things on this list. Read. Journal. Bake. Cook. Just <em>be</em>. I started doing this on Saturday evenings, and the quality of my sleep improved almost immediately. You'll be amazed at how long an evening feels when you're not losing hours to your screen. It's a little bit uncomfortable at first, but that discomfort is actually your brain remembering what rest feels like.</p>

        <h2>The Whole Point</h2>
        <p>A cozy weekend isn't about being lazy or unproductive. It's about being intentional with your rest. It's about filling your cup so you can pour into the week ahead. You don't need to do all ten of these things in one weekend &mdash; pick two or three that make your heart happy and lean into them fully. No guilt, no FOMO, just genuine, unhurried rest.</p>
        <p>You deserve a weekend that feels like a warm blanket. So go give yourself one.</p>
